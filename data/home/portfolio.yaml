    text: "We are convinced that a good econometric framework must possess two key features:

    - It should build models that describe reality as comprehensively as possible, even if those models are really complex.

    - It should do this in a way that is as simple and painless for the Data Scientist as possible.


    FERMATRICA is designed to meet these requirements to the fullest extent.

    Build models that go far beyond the complexity of a simple time series model. Combine additive and multiplicative effects, construct panel models, add auxiliary models, and link model chains together. Use local and global optimization algorithms, and specify transformation parameters manually if necessary.


    Conduct statistical analysis of the model during and after construction, perform retro-analysis of the model on historical data, and optimize the split and budget for a specified future period. Special variable transformations tailored to business realities are at your disposal. The results of your work can be exported to PPTX slides in a semi-finished state.


    Set the main model parameters in a human-friendly XLSX config file, using the programming environment only for writing the basic flow, outputting results, and customizing modeling and reporting. Display model statistics, graphs, and tables in the IDE console or embed them in a Jupyter Notebook using the extensive library of reporting functions.

    text: "FERMATRICA is a set of open-source libraries. To get started, it is usually sufficient to have programming skills in Python and appropriate mathematical training. The developers make efforts to ensure that the framework primarily depends on well-known and long-term supported libraries.


    FERMATRICA itself is in a state of continuous development, focusing on both bug finding and fixing, as well as the addition of new features.


    With extensive out-of-the-box capabilities, FERMATRICA also offers broad customization options for the modeler without requiring changes to the framework's source code. If that is not enough, you can always fork the project and modify the code as needed.
